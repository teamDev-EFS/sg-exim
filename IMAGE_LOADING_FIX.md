# 🖼️ Image Loading Fix - Complete!

## ❌ **The Problem:**

Images were not loading because:

- Image files were in `src/assets/images/`
- But the code was looking for them in `public/images/`
- In production, only files in `public/` directory are accessible

## ✅ **The Solution:**

1. **Copied all images** from `src/assets/images/` to `public/images/`
2. **Updated all image paths** in code to use `/images/` (which maps to `public/images/`)
3. **Built the project** - images are now in `dist/images/`

## 📁 **Images Now Available:**

All these images are now accessible at `/images/[filename]`:

### **Logos:**

- ✅ `11eximoverseas-logo.svg` - Main logo
- ✅ `11eximoverseas-logo.png` - Logo PNG version

### **Product Images:**

- ✅ `jasmine-rice.jpg` - Premium Basmati Rice
- ✅ `pure-jaggery.jpg` - Natural Jaggery Blocks
- ✅ `onion_garlic.jpeg` - Fresh Garlic & Onion
- ✅ `premium_spices.jpg` - Premium Spices Collection
- ✅ `Makhana.jpg` - Makhana & Millets
- ✅ `scented candles.webp` - Scented Candles Collection

### **Other Images:**

- ✅ `globalfoods.jpg` - Home page image
- ✅ `Hukam Chand Gupta.jpeg` - Team member photo
- ✅ `Yawal Gupta.jpeg` - Team member photo
- ✅ And many more...

## 🚀 **Deploy Now:**

```bash
# Commit and push the changes
git add public/images/
git commit -m "Add all images to public directory for production"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ **After Deployment:**

- ✅ **Logo will load** in header and footer
- ✅ **All product images will display** correctly
- ✅ **Team photos will show** properly
- ✅ **Home page images will work**
- ✅ **No more broken image links**

## 🔍 **How It Works:**

- **Development**: Vite serves files from `public/` directory
- **Production**: Netlify serves files from `dist/` directory
- **Image Paths**: `/images/filename.jpg` maps to `public/images/filename.jpg`
- **Build Process**: Vite copies `public/` to `dist/` during build

---

**All images are now ready and will load correctly after deployment!** 🎉
