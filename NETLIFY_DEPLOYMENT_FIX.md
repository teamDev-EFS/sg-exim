# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Fix

## ❌ **The Problem**

Netlify is looking for a `frontend` directory that doesn't exist:

```
Base directory does not exist: /opt/build/repo/frontend
```

## ✅ **The Solution**

### 1. **Updated netlify.toml**

I've added `base = "."` to explicitly tell Netlify to use the root directory.

### 2. **Netlify Site Settings**

In your Netlify dashboard, make sure these settings are correct:

**Build & Deploy → Site Settings:**

- **Base directory**: Leave empty (or set to `.`)
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`

### 3. **Repository Structure**

Your project structure is:

```
11eximoverseas/
├── src/                    # Frontend source code
├── package.json           # Frontend dependencies
├── netlify.toml          # Netlify configuration
├── dist/                  # Built files (after npm run build)
└── backend/               # Backend code (separate)
```

### 4. **Deployment Steps**

1. **Commit and push** your changes to GitHub
2. **In Netlify dashboard**:
   - Go to your site settings
   - Under "Build & Deploy" → "Build settings"
   - Make sure:
     - Base directory: **empty** (or `.`)
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `dist`
3. **Trigger a new deployment**

### 5. **Alternative: Manual Configuration**

If the issue persists, you can manually configure in Netlify:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Build & Deploy** → **Build settings**
2. Click **"Edit settings"**
3. Set:
   - **Base directory**: (leave empty)
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
4. Save and redeploy

### 6. **Verify Environment Variables**

Make sure these are set in Netlify:

- `VITE_API_URL` = `https://one1eximoverseas.onrender.com/api`
- `VITE_APP_NAME` = `TrustGlobalExports`
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = `API_KEY`

## 🔧 **Quick Fix Commands**

```bash
# 1. Build locally to test
npm run build

# 2. Check if dist folder is created
ls -la dist/

# 3. Test the build locally
npm run preview
```

## 📋 **Checklist**

- [ ] `netlify.toml` has `base = "."`
- [ ] Netlify base directory is empty or set to `.`
- [ ] Build command is `npm run build`
- [ ] Publish directory is `dist`
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Repository is pushed to GitHub

## 🚨 **If Still Failing**

1. Check Netlify build logs for specific errors
2. Verify all files are committed to GitHub
3. Make sure `package.json` is in the root directory
4. Ensure `dist` folder is generated after `npm run build`

**The fix should resolve the "Base directory does not exist" error!** ✅
