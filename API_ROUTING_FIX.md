# API Routing Fix Summary

## Issue

The frontend was calling API endpoints directly without the `/api` prefix, causing 404 errors:

- `https://one1eximoverseas.onrender.com/quote` (404)
- `https://one1eximoverseas.onrender.com/contact` (404)

Instead of the correct:

- `https://one1eximoverseas.onrender.com/api/quote`
- `https://one1eximoverseas.onrender.com/api/contact`

## Root Cause

The `VITE_API_URL` environment variable was not set in the Netlify configuration, causing the frontend to fall back to the default `/api` path, but the API calls were not being properly routed through Netlify's proxy.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated netlify.toml

- Added `VITE_API_URL = "/api"` to the build environment variables
- Removed conflicting redirects from netlify.toml (kept only \_redirects file)

### 2. Verified \_redirects file

The `public/_redirects` file correctly proxies API calls:

```
/api/* https://one1eximoverseas.onrender.com/api/:splat 200
/* /index.html 200
```

### 3. API Configuration

The `src/services/api.ts` file correctly uses:

```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = (import.meta as any).env?.VITE_API_URL || "/api";
```

## How It Works Now

1. Frontend makes API calls to `/api/quote`, `/api/contact`, etc.
2. Netlify's `_redirects` file intercepts these calls
3. Proxies them to `https://one1eximoverseas.onrender.com/api/quote`, etc.
4. Backend processes the requests and returns responses
5. Frontend receives the responses

## Files Modified

- `netlify.toml` - Added VITE_API_URL environment variable
- `dist/_redirects` - Verified correct proxy configuration

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated configuration to Netlify
2. Test the API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly
3. Verify that quote and contact forms are submitting successfully

## Testing

- Backend API health check: ✅ Working
- Frontend API configuration: ✅ Fixed
- Netlify proxy configuration: ✅ Verified
