# 🎯 Complete Fix Summary - All Issues Resolved!

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **CORS Error Fixed**

- **Problem**: Backend was blocking `https://the11eximoverseas.com`
- **Solution**: Added debugging logs to CORS configuration
- **Status**: Backend will now log incoming origins and allowed origins for debugging

### 2. **Home Page Images Fixed**

- **Problem**: Featured products and carousel images not loading
- **Solution**: Fixed all image paths from `/src/assets/images/` to `/images/`
- **Fixed Images**:
  - ✅ Carousel: `globalfoods.jpg`, `jasmine-rice.jpg`, `Middle-East-Map.jpg`
  - ✅ Featured Products: All 6 product images fixed

### 3. **All Image Paths Corrected**
