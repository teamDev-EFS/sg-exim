# Input Text Visibility Fix Summary

## Issue

The text in input fields within the quote and contact forms was not visible because the text color was too light or the same as the background color. Users could only see the text when selecting it.

## Root Cause

The input fields were missing the `text-gray-900` CSS class, which sets the text color to a dark gray that's clearly visible against the white background.

## Forms Affected

1. **Footer Quote Form** - Request Quote modal
2. **Home Page Quote Form** - Get Quote modal for featured products
3. **Team Page Contact Form** - Contact Our Team modal

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Footer Quote Form (`src/components/Footer.tsx`)

Added `text-gray-900` class to all input fields:

- Full Name input
- Email Address input
- Phone Number input
- Company Name input
- Product input (readonly)
- Quantity input
- Additional Requirements textarea

### 2. Home Page Quote Form (`src/pages/Home.tsx`)

Added `text-gray-900` class to all input fields:

- Full Name input
- Email Address input
- Phone Number input
- Company Name input
- Product input (readonly)
- Quantity input
- Additional Requirements textarea

### 3. Team Page Contact Form (`src/pages/Team.tsx`)

Added `text-gray-900` class to all input fields:

- Full Name input
- Email Address input
- Phone Number input
- Company Name input
- Message textarea

## Before and After

### Before

```css
className="w-full px-3 py-2 border rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-500"
```

Text was invisible or very light.

### After

```css
className="w-full px-3 py-2 border rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-500 text-gray-900"
```

Text is now clearly visible in dark gray.

## Result

- ✅ All input field text is now clearly visible
