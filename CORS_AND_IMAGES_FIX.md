# 🔧 CORS and Images Fix

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **CORS Error Fix**

**Problem**: Frontend (Netlify) couldn't communicate with backend (Render) due to CORS restrictions.

**Solution**:

- Updated `render.yaml` to allow both domains:
  ```yaml
  CORS_ORIGIN: https://www.the11eximoverseas.com,https://the11eximoverseas.netlify.app
  ```
- Updated `backend/server.js` to handle multiple CORS origins dynamically

### 2. **Images Not Loading Fix**

**Problem**: Images were using incorrect paths (`/src/assets/images/`) that don't work in production.

**Solution**:

- Fixed image paths in:
  - `src/components/Footer.tsx`
  - `src/components/Header.tsx`
  - `src/pages/Home.tsx`
- Changed from `/src/assets/images/` to `/images/`

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps:**

### 1. **Backend (Render) - Deploy First**

```bash
# Commit and push backend changes
git add backend/server.js render.yaml
git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration for multiple origins"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Frontend (Netlify) - Deploy Second**

```bash
# Commit and push frontend changes
git add src/
git commit -m "Fix image paths for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🧪 **Testing:**

### 1. **Test CORS Fix**

- Visit your Netlify site: `https://the11eximoverseas.netlify.app`
- Try submitting the contact form
- Check browser console - no more CORS errors

### 2. **Test Images**

- Verify logo loads in header
- Verify logo loads in footer
- Verify all product images load correctly

## 📋 **What Was Fixed:**

### CORS Configuration:

- ✅ Backend now accepts requests from both domains
- ✅ Dynamic origin checking for better security
- ✅ Proper error logging for debugging

### Image Paths:

- ✅ All images now use correct public directory paths
- ✅ Images will load correctly in production
- ✅ No more broken image links

## 🔍 **Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Backend deployed to Render with new CORS config
- [ ] Frontend deployed to Netlify with fixed image paths
- [ ] Contact form works without CORS errors
- [ ] All images load correctly
- [ ] Logo displays in header and footer
- [ ] Product images display properly

## 🚨 **If Issues Persist:**

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly in Render
4. **Check Netlify build logs** for any deployment issues

**Both CORS and image loading issues should now be resolved!** ✅
